"""University envelope assignments -- demonstrates three-layer envelope model.

Envelopes define spending limits, allowed actions, and other constraints
for each role. The Dean of Engineering sets the CS Chair's envelope;
the CS Chair's effective envelope is the intersection of all ancestor
envelopes down to their position.

Key demonstration:
- President envelope: max_spend_usd=$100,000, all actions
- Dean of Engineering envelope: max_spend_usd=$50,000, subset of actions
- CS Chair envelope: max_spend_usd=$10,000, further restricted actions
- Monotonic tightening: each child is <= parent on every dimension
