"""University clearance assignments -- demonstrates clearance independent of authority.

Key demonstration:
- IRB Director (specialist, junior): SECRET clearance for 'human-subjects' compartment
- Dean of Engineering (senior): CONFIDENTIAL only (no human-subjects access)
- Disciplinary Officer: CONFIDENTIAL for 'student-records' compartment
- CS Faculty Member: RESTRICTED (standard academic)
- HR Director: CONFIDENTIAL for 'personnel' compartment

This proves that clearance is orthogonal to seniority -- a junior specialist
can hold higher clearance than a senior executive when the knowledge domain
requires it.
