"""University barriers and bridges -- demonstrates architectural containment.

Information barriers prevent knowledge from flowing between organizational
units that should not share data. Bridges and KSPs create controlled
exceptions to these barriers.

Barriers:
- NO KSP between Student Affairs (D1-R1-D3) and Academic Affairs (D1-R1-D1)
  for student disciplinary records

Bridges:
- Provost <-> VP Admin (Standing, budget coordination, RESTRICTED)
- Dean of Engineering <-> Dean of Medicine (Scoped, joint research, CONFIDENTIAL,
  expires in 6 months)

KSPs:
- HR -> Academic Affairs (personnel records, RESTRICTED, one-way)
