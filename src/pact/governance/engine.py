"""GovernanceEngine -- the single entry point for PACT governance decisions.

All governance state access and mutations go through this class. It composes
compilation, envelopes, clearance, access enforcement, and audit into a
thread-safe facade. Verticals (astra, arbor) use GovernanceEngine as their
primary interface.

Design principles:
1. Thread-safe: All public methods acquire self._lock.
2. Fail-closed: verify_action() catches ALL exceptions and returns BLOCKED.
3. Audit by default: Every mutation and decision emits EATP audit anchors
   when audit_chain is configured.
4. NaN-safe: Relies on M7 guards in envelopes.py and schema.py.
5. Frozen returns: All returned objects are frozen dataclasses.
