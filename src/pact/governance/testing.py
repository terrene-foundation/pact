"""MockGovernedAgent -- deterministic testing without LLM.

The MockGovernedAgent runs a scripted sequence of tool actions through
full PACT governance enforcement. This enables integration testing of
governance rules without requiring an LLM backend.

Usage::

    @governed_tool("read", cost=0.0)
    def tool_read() -> str:
        return "read_result"

    @governed_tool("write", cost=10.0)
    def tool_write() -> str:
        return "write_result"

    mock = MockGovernedAgent(
        engine=engine,
        role_address="D1-R1-T1-R1",
        tools=[tool_read, tool_write],
        script=["read", "write", "read"],
    )
    results = mock.run()  # ["read_result", "write_result", "read_result"]

Governance is fully enforced: blocked actions raise GovernanceBlockedError,
held actions raise GovernanceHeldError. The script execution stops at the
first governance error (fail-fast).
