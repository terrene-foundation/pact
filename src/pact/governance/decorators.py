"""Governance decorators -- @governed_tool for marking functions as governance-aware.

The @governed_tool decorator marks a function with governance metadata
(action name, cost, resource) so that PactGovernedAgent and MockGovernedAgent
can auto-register the tool and route it through governance verification.

Decorated functions remain callable -- the decorator does NOT intercept
execution. Governance enforcement is performed by PactGovernedAgent.execute_tool().

    """Decorator marking a function as governance-aware.

    Attaches governance metadata to the function:
    - _governed: True
    - _governance_action: str (the action name for governance checks)
    - _governance_cost: float (cost for financial envelope checks)
    - _governance_resource: str | None (resource for knowledge checks)

    The decorated function is still directly callable. Governance
    enforcement is performed when the tool is executed through
    PactGovernedAgent.execute_tool(), not by this decorator.

    Args:
        action_name: The governance action name (e.g., "read", "write_report").
        cost: Cost of this tool execution for financial constraint checks.
            Defaults to 0.0 (no financial impact).
        resource: Optional resource identifier for knowledge access checks.
            Defaults to None (no knowledge check required).

    Returns:
        A decorator that attaches governance metadata to the wrapped function.

    Example::

        @governed_tool("write_report", cost=50.0)
        def write_report(content: str) -> str:
            return f"Report: {content}"

        assert write_report._governed is True
        assert write_report._governance_action == "write_report"
        assert write_report._governance_cost == 50.0
