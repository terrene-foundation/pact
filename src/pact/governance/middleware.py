"""PactGovernanceMiddleware -- Kaizen middleware for governance enforcement.

The middleware provides a pre-execution check for Kaizen agent tool calls
without requiring subclassing. It returns GovernanceVerdict objects that
the caller (Kaizen bridge, agent framework) can use to decide whether
to proceed, hold, or block.

Unlike PactGovernedAgent (which raises exceptions), the middleware is a
low-level building block that returns verdicts for the caller to handle.
This allows integration with different execution frameworks.

Thread-safe: delegates to GovernanceEngine which has its own lock.
