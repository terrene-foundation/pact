# /release - SDK Release Command

Standalone SDK release command for the BUILD repo. Not a workspace phase — runs independently after any number of implement/redteam cycles. Handles PyPI publishing, documentation deployment, and CI management for the `kailash` Python SDK and its framework packages.

**IMPORTANT**: This is `/release` (BUILD repo command). `/deploy` is for USE repos only. See `rules/zero-tolerance.md` for the BUILD vs USE boundary.

## Deployment Config

Read `deploy/deployment-config.md` at the project root. This is the single source of truth for how this SDK publishes releases.

## Mode Detection

### If `deploy/deployment-config.md` does NOT exist → Onboard Mode

Run the SDK release onboarding process:

1. **Analyze the codebase**
   - What packages exist? (main `kailash` package + sub-packages like `kailash-dataflow`, `kailash-nexus`, `kailash-kaizen`)
   - What build system? (`pyproject.toml` — setuptools, hatch, maturin, etc.)
   - Existing CI workflows? (`.github/workflows/`)
   - Documentation setup? (sphinx `conf.py`, mkdocs.yml, docs/ directory)
   - Test infrastructure? (pytest config, tox, nox)
   - Multi-package structure? (monorepo vs separate packages)

2. **Ask the human**
   - PyPI publishing strategy: TestPyPI first? Wheel-only (proprietary)?
   - API token setup: `~/.pypirc` or CI secrets?
   - Documentation hosting: ReadTheDocs, GitHub Pages, or other?
   - CI system: GitHub Actions? Self-hosted runners?
   - Multi-package versioning strategy: lockstep or independent?
   - Changelog format: Keep a Changelog, conventional-changelog, or custom?
   - Release cadence: on-demand, scheduled, or tag-triggered?

3. **Research current best practices**
   - Use web search for current PyPI publishing guidance
   - Use web search for current CI/CD patterns for Python packages
   - Check current `build`, `twine`, `maturin` tool versions and syntax
   - Do NOT rely on encoded knowledge — tools and best practices change

4. **Create `deploy/deployment-config.md`**
   - Document all decisions with rationale
   - Include step-by-step SDK release runbook
   - Include rollback procedure (PyPI yank + corrective release)
   - Include release checklist

5. **STOP — present to human for review**

### If `deploy/deployment-config.md` EXISTS → Execute Mode

Read the config and execute the appropriate track:

#### Step 0: Release Scope Detection

Before any release work, determine WHAT needs releasing by analyzing unreleased changes:

1. **Diff analysis** — Compare `main` against the last release tag for each package:

   ```
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD -- kailash/           → Core SDK changes?
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD -- (check kailash-dataflow changes)  → DataFlow changes?
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD -- (check kailash-kaizen changes)    → Kaizen changes?
   git log <last-tag>..HEAD -- (check kailash-nexus changes)     → Nexus changes?
   ```

2. **Present release plan to human** — Show which packages have unreleased changes and propose:
   - Which packages to release
   - Version bump type for each (major/minor/patch)
   - Whether framework packages need SDK dependency updates
   - **STOP and wait for human approval before proceeding**

#### Step 1: Version Bump (All Affected Packages)

For each package being released, update version in BOTH locations. Missing either causes install/import mismatches that break users.

**CRITICAL**: The `__version__` in `__init__.py` MUST match `pyproject.toml`. This is the #1 source of "my package didn't update" complaints. The session-start hook verifies this automatically.

##### Core SDK (`kailash`)

| File                      | Field                   | Example                 |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `pyproject.toml`          | `version = "X.Y.Z"`     | `version = "1.0.0"`     |
| `kailash/__init__.py` | `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"` | `__version__ = "1.0.0"` |

##### Framework Packages

Each framework has 2 version locations PLUS the SDK dependency pin:

**kailash-dataflow:**

| File                                                 | Field                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `kailash-dataflow/pyproject.toml`           | `version = "X.Y.Z"`            |
| `dataflow/__init__.py` | `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`        |
| `kailash-dataflow/pyproject.toml`           | `dependencies: kailash>=A.B.C` |

**kailash-kaizen:**

| File                                             | Field                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `kailash-kaizen/pyproject.toml`         | `version = "X.Y.Z"`            |
| `kaizen/__init__.py` | `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`        |
| `kailash-kaizen/pyproject.toml`         | `dependencies: kailash>=A.B.C` |

**kailash-nexus:**

| File                                           | Field                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `kailash-nexus/pyproject.toml`        | `version = "X.Y.Z"`            |
| `nexus/__init__.py` | `__version__ = "X.Y.Z"`        |
| `kailash-nexus/pyproject.toml`        | `dependencies: kailash>=A.B.C` |

##### SDK Dependency Pin Update Rule

When the core SDK version is bumped, ALL framework packages MUST update their `kailash>=` dependency pin to the new SDK version — even if the framework itself is not being released. This ensures `pip install kailash-dataflow` always pulls the correct minimum SDK.

Also update the main SDK's optional extras in `pyproject.toml` to reference the latest framework versions.

#### Step 2: Version Consistency Verification

After bumping, verify ALL versions are consistent:

```bash
# Core SDK — both must match
grep 'version' pyproject.toml | head -1
grep '__version__' kailash/__init__.py

# Each framework — version + dependency must be correct
for fw in kailash-dataflow kailash-kaizen kailash-nexus; do
  echo "=== $fw ==="
  grep 'version' $fw/pyproject.toml | head -1
  grep '__version__' $fw/src/*/__init__.py
  grep 'kailash>=' $fw/pyproject.toml
done
```

**BLOCK release if any mismatch is found.** Fix before proceeding.

#### Step 3: Pre-release Prep

1. Run full test suite across all supported Python versions
2. Run linting and formatting checks (`black --check`, `ruff check`)
3. Update CHANGELOG.md for each package being released
4. Security review (MANDATORY)
5. **Update README.md** (MANDATORY for minor/major releases — BLOCKS release if skipped)
   - Verify "Why Kailash?" section reflects new capabilities added in this release
   - Update architecture diagram version number to match release version
   - Verify all feature claims match actual implementation (no overselling — R4 audit checks this)
   - Check that new entry points, CLI commands, or REST endpoints are documented
   - Run: `grep -c 'v0.XX.X' README.md` to confirm version appears
   - **BLOCK release if README still references old version or omits major new features**
6. **Verify Sphinx docs build** (MANDATORY — BLOCKS release if build fails)
   - Run `cd docs && python build_docs.py` locally — must succeed with zero errors
   - Verify new module docstrings appear in API reference (spot-check 3 new modules)
   - Check that docstrings updated during implementation are accurate (no stale "TODO" or "simulated" claims)
   - The `docs-deploy.yml` CI workflow auto-deploys on push to main when `docs/**`, `README.md`, or `CHANGELOG.md` change
   - **BLOCK release if Sphinx build fails or new modules are missing from API reference**

#### Step 4: Build and Validate

1. Build wheels (and sdist if open-source): `python -m build`
2. For frameworks: `cd apps/kailash-<name> && python -m build`
3. Upload to TestPyPI: `twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*.whl`
4. Verify TestPyPI install in clean venv
5. For major/minor releases: run smoke tests against TestPyPI package

#### Step 5: Git Workflow

Main branch is protected — all changes require a PR with review.

1. Create release branch: `git checkout -b release/vX.Y.Z`
2. Commit with conventional message: `chore: release vX.Y.Z`
3. Push branch: `git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z`
4. Create PR: `gh pr create --title "chore: release vX.Y.Z" --body "..."`
5. Wait for CI to pass, then merge (admin can self-approve)
6. After merge, tag on main: `git checkout main && git pull && git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "..." && git push --tags`
7. Tags trigger the publish-pypi.yml workflow automatically

#### Step 6: Publish to Production PyPI

Publish in dependency order — core MUST be available before frameworks:

1. `kailash` (core) → verify available: `pip install kailash==X.Y.Z --dry-run`
2. `kailash-dataflow` → verify available
3. `kailash-nexus` → verify available
4. `kailash-kaizen` → verify available

For each: upload wheels, verify production install in clean venv, create GitHub Release with tag.

#### Step 7: Post-release

1. **Update COC template repo** (MANDATORY)

   The USE repo (`kailash-coc-claude-py`) is the COC template users clone for new projects. Its dependency pins MUST be updated to match the just-published versions, otherwise new projects start with stale SDK versions.

   Update `pyproject.toml` in the USE repo:

   ```
   kailash-coc-claude-py/pyproject.toml
   ```

   Dependency pins to update:

   ```
   "kailash>=X.Y.Z"           → new core SDK version
   "kailash-dataflow>=X.Y.Z"  → new or current DataFlow version
   "kailash-kaizen>=X.Y.Z"    → new or current Kaizen version
   "kailash-nexus>=X.Y.Z"     → new or current Nexus version
   ```

   Commit and push the change to the USE repo with message: `chore: bump SDK dependency pins to latest release`

2. **Verify documentation deployed** (MANDATORY)
   - Check `gh run list --workflow=docs-deploy.yml --limit=1` — must be `completed success`
   - If failed: check logs with `gh run view <id> --log-failed`, fix, and re-trigger
   - Verify live docs at the GitHub Pages URL
   - GitHub Pages must be configured: Settings → Pages → Source: "GitHub Actions"
3. Document release in `deploy/deployments/YYYY-MM-DD-vX.Y.Z.md`
4. Announce if applicable

#### CI Management Track

1. **Monitor CI runs** — `gh run list`, `gh run watch`
2. **Debug CI failures** — download logs, reproduce locally
3. **Manage workflows** — update GitHub Actions, test matrix, runner config

## Package Registry

Quick reference for all version locations in this monorepo:

| Package          | pyproject.toml                             | **init**.py                                          | SDK Dep     |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| kailash          | `pyproject.toml`                           | `kailash/__init__.py`                            | —           |
| kailash-dataflow | `kailash-dataflow/pyproject.toml` | `dataflow/__init__.py` | `kailash>=` |
| kailash-kaizen   | `kailash-kaizen/pyproject.toml`   | `kaizen/__init__.py`     | `kailash>=` |
| kailash-nexus    | `kailash-nexus/pyproject.toml`    | `nexus/__init__.py`       | `kailash>=` |

## Agent Teams

- **deployment-specialist** — Analyze codebase, run onboarding, guide SDK release
- **git-release-specialist** — Git workflow, PR creation, version management
- **security-reviewer** — Pre-release security audit (MANDATORY)
- **testing-specialist** — Verify test coverage before release
- **documentation-validator** — Verify documentation builds and code examples

## Critical Rules

- NEVER publish to PyPI without running the full test suite first
- NEVER skip TestPyPI validation for major or minor releases
- NEVER commit PyPI tokens to source — use `~/.pypirc` or CI secrets
- NEVER skip security review before publishing
- NEVER release a framework without updating its `kailash>=` dependency to match the current SDK version
- ALWAYS update version in BOTH locations (pyproject.toml AND **init**.py) — missing **init**.py causes "my package didn't update" bugs
- ALWAYS verify the published package installs correctly in a clean venv
- ALWAYS publish in dependency order: core SDK first, then frameworks
- ALWAYS document releases in `deploy/deployments/`
- ALWAYS update the COC template repo (`kailash-coc-claude-py/pyproject.toml`) dependency pins after publishing
- Research current tool syntax — do not assume stale knowledge is correct

**Automated enforcement**: `validate-deployment.js` hook automatically blocks commits containing credentials (AWS keys, Azure secrets, GCP service account JSON, private keys, GitHub/PyPI/Docker tokens) in deployment files.
