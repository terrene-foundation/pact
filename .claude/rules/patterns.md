# Kailash Pattern Rules

## Runtime Execution

MUST use `runtime.execute(workflow.build())`.

**Why:** Calling `runtime.execute(workflow)` without `.build()` passes an unvalidated builder object, causing a cryptic `AttributeError` deep in the runtime instead of a clear validation error.

```python
runtime = LocalRuntime()
results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())

# ❌ workflow.execute(runtime)  — wrong direction
# ❌ runtime.execute(workflow)  — missing .build()
```

## Node API

- Node IDs MUST be string literals (not variables, not f-strings)
  **Why:** Dynamic node IDs break workflow graph analysis, checkpoint recovery, and node-level debugging since the ID is only known at runtime.
- 4-parameter order: `add_node("NodeType", "node_id", {config}, connections)`
- Absolute imports only (`from kailash.workflow.builder import WorkflowBuilder`)
  **Why:** Relative imports break when files are moved or when the same module is loaded from different entry points, causing silent import duplication.
- Load .env before any operation (see `env-models.md`)

## DataFlow Express (Default for CRUD)

Use `db.express` for all single-record CRUD. WorkflowBuilder only for multi-step operations.

**Why:** WorkflowBuilder for simple CRUD is ~23x slower due to graph construction, validation, and runtime overhead that adds zero value for single-record operations.

```python
result = await db.express.create("User", {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"})
user = await db.express.read("User", str(result["id"]))
users = await db.express.list("User", {"active": True})
await db.express.update("User", str(result["id"]), {"name": "Bob"})
await db.express.delete("User", str(result["id"]))

# ❌ Don't use WorkflowBuilder for simple CRUD — 23x slower
```

## DataFlow Models & Workflows

```python
@db.model
class User:
    id: int = field(primary_key=True)  # PK MUST be named 'id'
    # Never manually set timestamps — auto-managed

# CreateNode: FLAT params (not nested)
workflow.add_node("CreateUser", "create", {"name": "test"})
# ❌ {"data": {"name": "test"}}

# UpdateNode: filter + fields
workflow.add_node("UpdateUser", "update", {"filter": {"id": 1}, "fields": {"name": "new"}})
```

## Nexus

```python
app = Nexus()
app.register(my_workflow)  # Register first
app.start()                # Then start
session = app.create_session()  # Unified session for state across channels
```

## Kaizen

```python
# Delegate (recommended for autonomous agents)
from kaizen_agents import Delegate
delegate = Delegate(model=os.environ["OPENAI_PROD_MODEL"])

# BaseAgent (for custom logic only)
from kaizen.core import BaseAgent, Signature, InputField, OutputField
```

## Async vs Sync Runtime

- **Docker/Nexus**: `AsyncLocalRuntime` + `await runtime.execute_workflow_async(workflow.build())`
- **CLI/Scripts**: `LocalRuntime` + `runtime.execute(workflow.build())`

## SQLite Connection Management

- Acquire through `AsyncSQLitePool` (`acquire_read` / `acquire_write`)
- URI shared-cache for `:memory:` (`file:memdb_NAME?mode=memory&cache=shared`)
- `async with` for all transactions
- Default PRAGMAs on every connection (WAL, busy_timeout, synchronous, cache_size, foreign_keys)
- Always set `max_read_connections` (bounded concurrency)
- MUST NOT use bare `aiosqlite.connect()` — go through the pool

**Why:** Bare `aiosqlite.connect()` bypasses WAL mode, busy_timeout, and connection limits, causing "database is locked" errors under concurrent access.

## Async Resource Cleanup

- All async resource classes MUST implement `__del__` with `ResourceWarning`
- Use `def __del__(self, _warnings=warnings)` signature (survives interpreter shutdown)
- Set class-level defaults for `__del__` safety
- MUST NOT use `asyncio` in `__del__` — async cleanup in finalizers is unreliable

**Why:** Without `__del__` warnings, leaked connections and file handles go undetected until resource exhaustion crashes the process in production.
