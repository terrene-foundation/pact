# Testing Rules

## Scope

These rules apply to all test files and test-related code.

## MUST Rules

### 0. Test-Once Protocol (MANDATORY)

Tests run ONCE per code change, not once per phase. This eliminates redundant test execution across `/implement`, `/redteam`, and pre-commit.

**The Protocol:**

1. `/implement` runs the full test suite ONCE per todo and writes `.test-results` to the workspace
2. `/redteam` READS `.test-results` -- does NOT re-run existing tests
3. `/redteam` runs only NEW tests it creates (E2E user flows, Playwright, Marionette)
4. Pre-commit hook runs Tier 1 unit tests as a fast safety net
5. CI runs the full matrix as the final gate

**`.test-results` artifact:**

Written to `workspaces/<project>/.test-results` after each `/implement` todo completion. Contains commit hash, pass/fail counts, and regression count. Red team and deploy phases read this file instead of re-running.

**Re-run exceptions:**

- Code changed since `.test-results` was written (commit hash mismatch)
- Infrastructure-specific tests (e.g., ran against SQLite, need PostgreSQL verification)
- Red team suspects a specific test is wrong (re-run THAT test only)

**Enforced by**: `/implement` and `/redteam` command templates
**Violation**: Wasted compute, context window bloat, slower iteration

### 0b. Regression Testing (MANDATORY)

Every bug fix MUST include a regression test BEFORE the fix is merged.

**The Rule:**

1. When a bug is found, the FIRST step is writing a test that REPRODUCES the bug
2. The test MUST fail before the fix and pass after
3. Regression tests go in `tests/regression/test_issue_*.py`
4. Mark with `@pytest.mark.regression`
5. The test name includes the issue number (e.g., `test_issue_42_user_creation_drops_pk`)
6. Regression tests are NEVER deleted -- they are permanent guards

**Why:** Without regression tests, the same bugs keep coming back. A fix verified only by code review is not verified at all.

**Pattern:**

```python
# tests/regression/test_issue_42.py
import pytest

@pytest.mark.regression
def test_issue_42_user_creation_preserves_explicit_id():
    """Regression: #42 -- CreateUser silently drops explicit id.

    The bug: when auto_increment is enabled, passing an explicit id was silently ignored.
    Fixed in: commit abc1234
    """
    # Reproduce the exact bug from the issue
    # ...
    assert result["id"] == "custom-id-value"
```

**Enforcement:**

- Pre-commit: `pytest -m regression` must pass
- Pre-merge: reviewer verifies regression test exists for every bug fix
- Pre-release: regression suite is a mandatory checklist item

**Applies to**: All bug fixes
**Violation**: BLOCK merge -- a fix without a regression test is not a fix

### 1. Test-First Development

Tests MUST be written before implementation for new features.

**Process**:

1. Write failing test that describes expected behavior
2. Implement minimum code to pass test
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

**Applies to**: New features, bug fixes
**Enforced by**: tdd-implementer agent
**Violation**: Code review flag

### 2. Coverage Requirements

Code changes MUST maintain or improve test coverage.

| Code Type         | Minimum Coverage |
| ----------------- | ---------------- |
| General           | 80%              |
| Financial         | 100%             |
| Authentication    | 100%             |
| Security-critical | 100%             |

**Enforced by**: CI coverage check
**Violation**: BLOCK merge

### 3. Real Infrastructure Recommended in Tiers 2-3

Integration and E2E tests SHOULD use real infrastructure where practical.

**Tier 1 (Unit Tests)**:

- Mocking ALLOWED
- Test isolated functions
- Fast execution (<1s per test)

**Tier 2 (Integration Tests)**:

- Real infrastructure recommended (real database, real API)
- Mocking is acceptable for external services that are difficult to provision
- Test component interactions

**Tier 3 (E2E Tests)**:

- Real infrastructure recommended
- Test full user journeys
- Real browser, real database when feasible

**Enforced by**: validate-workflow hook
**Violation**: Review recommendation

## MUST NOT Rules

### 1. No Test Pollution

Tests MUST NOT affect other tests.

**Required**:

- Clean setup/teardown
- Isolated test databases
- No shared mutable state

### 2. No Flaky Tests

Tests MUST be deterministic.

**Prohibited**:

- Random data without seeds
- Time-dependent assertions
- Network calls to external services (Tier 1)

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

```
tests/
├── regression/     # Tier 0: Permanent bug reproduction tests
├── unit/           # Tier 1: Mocking allowed
├── integration/    # Tier 2: Real infrastructure recommended
└── e2e/           # Tier 3: Real infrastructure recommended
```

### Naming Convention

```
test_[feature]_[scenario]_[expected_result].py
```

Example: `test_user_login_with_valid_credentials_succeeds.py`

## Kailash-Specific Testing

### DataFlow Testing

```python
# Tier 2: Use real database
@pytest.fixture
def db():
    db = DataFlow("sqlite:///:memory:")  # Real SQLite
    yield db
    db.close()

def test_user_creation(db):
    # Real database operations
    result = db.execute(CreateUser(name="test"))
    assert result.id is not None
```

### Workflow Testing

```python
# Tier 2: Use real runtime
def test_workflow_execution():
    runtime = LocalRuntime()
    workflow = build_workflow()
    results, run_id = runtime.execute(workflow.build())
    assert results is not None
```

## Exceptions

Testing exceptions require:

1. Written justification explaining why real infrastructure impossible
2. Approval from testing-specialist
3. Documentation in test file
4. Plan for removing exception
